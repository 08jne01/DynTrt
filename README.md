# DynTrt

DynTrts is a very small header only library (very WIP) initialy designed to emulate the runtime-concept however the scope of that is quite wide and for my selfish use case value semmantics (although better) are unavailable. So we have wide pointer like objects similar to rust instead.

## Installation

If you wish to use cmake add the subdirectory and then add the `DynTrt` as a link library to your target.
